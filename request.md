Hi owner of Jangala!

My name's Rich Thanki and I help run a charity called Jangala (www.janga.la). 
We help get internet access to people in natural disasters and needing humanitarian 
assistance. Would you be willing to transfer to us this domaim, as we'd like to actively 
open source projects that we're working on? You can contact me on rich AT janga.la

Thank you :)
